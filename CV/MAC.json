      "description": "When I told my father I wanted to study Engineering he got quite happy, as he thought an Engineer always dresses in shirt and tie, as I always dressed in T-shirts. I chose Electronic Engineering. I have worked in three different sectors during the last 14 years: IoT, FPGA, and Power Electronics; and all three had in common that I was writing code and wearing a T-shirt. I am looking for a Software project where I can put to use and expand my knowledge of Digital and Power Electronics.",

RAP Sessions allow for exciting dialogue among attendees and presenters and are presented live during the conference.\nThe past few years have seen a remarkable growth in artificial intelligence in many applications. Power electronics is no exception in that researchers are investigating new ways to model and design power electronics using some form of artificial intelligence. This panel is comprised of several thought leaders in the area of power electronics design – both utilizing AI techniques and without. They will discuss aspects of power electronics design that AI can improve or at least provide keener insight, and where traditional design methods remain superior or necessary. Come join us to open your mind to whether new approaches are worthy of your consideration in your next design. Hearty participation is welcome!",

It is structured to enable engineers to develop their skills to utilise the full breadth of SystemVerilog features for verification. This includes how to exploit the potential of class-based verification and object oriented techniques using SystemVerilog, as well as application for standard test bench development and module-based verification.",
